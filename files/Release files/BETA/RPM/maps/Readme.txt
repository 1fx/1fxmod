You may upload your custom .ENT files. 
Files included in this archive are for BETA purposes only, suggested to use your own files for playing purposes.

-------------------
We now include 'alt' maps made by mappers of the game. Please check the credits (temp. location: http://1fx.uk.to/pub/docs/extras/credits.html) for a complete list of these submitters (may be updated regulary).

For an example of a booster & teleporter please check the H&S version of mp_shop (/h&s/mp_shop.ent).
For an example of the autolower please check the CTF version of mp_kam2 (/ctf/mp_kam2.ent).

The 'maps' folder has gotten a new structure since the latest BETA (rev 332, new in rev 362).
You may now put your maps in the 'gametype' folder. The old method still remains compatible.
Example for Hide&Seek, all these can be used to sort your .ENT files:

/maps/h&s/pra6.ent
/maps/h&s/pra6_h&s.ent
/maps/pra6_h&s.ent
/maps/pra6.ent

Example for Infiltration:

/maps/inf/mp_shop.ent
/maps/inf/mp_shop_inf.ent
/maps/mp_shop_inf.ent
/maps/mp_shop.ent

That's all to it!
